## Usage Patterns

### Basic Query Processing

```dart
final coordinator = SophisticatedRagCoordinator.instance;
await coordinator.initialize();

final result = await coordinator.processQuery(
  query: "I'm feeling anxious about my exam tomorrow",
  queryType: QueryType.text,
  userId: "user123",
);
```

### Voice-Enabled Queries

```dart
await coordinator.startVoiceListening();
// Voice recognition automatically processes Arabic/English
// Results include voice confidence and processed text
```
