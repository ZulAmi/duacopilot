## 🏗️ Architecture & Design Patterns

### Clean Architecture

```
Domain Layer (Entities)
├── Business logic and rules
├── Freezed data classes
└── JSON serialization

Service Layer
├── Platform integrations
├── Hardware sensor access
└── Voice recognition

Presentation Layer
├── Riverpod state management
├── Modern UI components
└── Animation controllers
```

### State Management - Riverpod

```dart
// Example: Qibla compass state
final qiblaCompassProvider = StateNotifierProvider<QiblaCompassNotifier, QiblaCompassState>((ref) {
  return QiblaCompassNotifier(ref.read(qiblaCompassServiceProvider));
});
```

### Data Models - Freezed

```dart
@freezed
class QiblaCompass with _$QiblaCompass {
  const factory QiblaCompass({
    required double direction,
    required double accuracy,
    required CalibrationQuality calibrationQuality,
    required DateTime lastUpdate,
  }) = _QiblaCompass;

  factory QiblaCompass.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) =>
      _$QiblaCompassFromJson(json);
}
```
